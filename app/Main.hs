TODO:
Presently all the code is here, in this file. We need to properly organize the code into modules.
This file can be the only file in the "app" directory.
Under "src", there will be a number of distinct files/modules:
* One module should contain all our data type declarations and type aliases. Doing this helps to avoid circular imports in large apps.
* Other modules can be created based on theme. For example, one module might contain "Text" utility functions.
* You'll probably want to put "threadServer" and the functions it calls ("interp") in a single module.
Modules should only export the functions that other modules need.

Keep in mind that in Haskell, killing a parent thread does NOT kill its children threads!
Threads must be manually managed via the "Async" library. This takes careful thought and consideration.
Threads should never be "leaked:" we don't ever want a situation in which a child thread is left running and no other threads are aware of it.
Of course, the app should be architected in such a way that when an exception is thrown, it is handled gracefully. First and foremost, an exception must be caught on/by the thread on which the exception was thrown. If the exception represents something critical or unexpected (it's a bug, etc. - this is the vast majority of exceptions that we'll encounter in practice), and the exception occurs on a child thread, then the child thread should rethrow the exception to the listen (main) thread. The listen thread's exception handler should catch the rethrown exception and gracefully shut down, manually killing all child threads in the process.
-}

{-
TODO:
To fix the thread leakage bug:
* The "/throw" command should throw an exception on the server thread.
* The server thread's exception handler should catch the exception and throw an exception to the listen thread.
* The listen thread's exception handler should catch the exception and gracefully shut the server down by doing the following:
1) Put a "Msg" in every "MsgQueue" indicating that the server is shutting down.
2) Wait for every talk thread to finish.

This thread polls the client's message queue and processes everything that comes down the queue.
It is named "threadServer" because this is where the bulk of server operations and logic reside.
But keep in mind that this function is executed for every client, and thus the code we write here is written from the standpoint of a single client (ie, the arguments to this function are the handle and message queue of a single client).

The Haskell language, software transactional memory, and this app are all architected in such a way that we need not concern ourselves with the usual pitfalls of sharing state across threads. This automatically rules out a whole class of potential bugs! Just remember the following:
1) If you are coding an operation that simply needs to read the state, use the "getState" helper function.
2) If you are coding an operation that needs to update the state, you must bundle the operation into an atomic unit: that is, a single function passed into the "modifyState" helper function. (The function passed to "modifyState" is itself passed the latest state.)
It's ensured that only one thread can modify the state (via "modifyState") at a time.
